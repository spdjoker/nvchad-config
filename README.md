# nvchad-config

This is my custom configuration for [NvChad](https://nvchad.com/docs/quickstart/install). 
This contains a custom theme inspired by Visual Studio 2022's C/C++ theme and some keybinds. 
It will be modified whenever NvChad alters some of its settings or I choose to add more language servers.
