# nvchad-config

This is my custom configuration for [NvChad](https://nvchad.com/docs/quickstart/install). 
This contains a custom theme inspired by Visual Studio 2022's C/C++ theme and some keybinds. 
It will be modified whenever NvChad alters some of its settings or I choose to add more language servers.

To apply these settings, first install Neovim and proceed to follow the NvChad installation steps.
Once done, head into the ``lua/custom`` folder and place the content of this repo inside or rename this project to ``custom`` so that you can pull again if you choose to use it.

However, I encourage you to customize your Neovim to your liking.
